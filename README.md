# Object Recognition using tensorFlow and Java

This project has been implemented to recognize an object from its image using a pre-trained InceptionV3 model which 
is trained to recognize objects from hundreds of classes including animals,birds,stationary,vehicles,etc.

The pre-trained Inception V3 model can be downloaded from the below link: https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/inception_dec_2015.zip
